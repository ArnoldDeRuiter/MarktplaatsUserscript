#Marktplaats - Just the search results.
Marktplaats Userscript

Marktplaats has made it a pain to find the real people who are selling stuff you are looking for, sometimes elimitating entire result pages from actual selling users, filling the results with users who pay for their ads, resellers and companies or webshops.
This userscript brings an end to that, and also unclutters the webpages. Also binding keyboard keys to quickly preform certain actions.

Feature list at the moment:

*  Removes commercial ads 
*  Removes a lot of clutter ads, and ads in between the results
*  Removes paid ads from users
*  Removes companies/webstores which place ads
*  Quick scroll through result pages by pressing the left and right arrow keys
*  Auto focus on searchbar
*  Quick focus on searchbar by pressing the "/" key
*  Contains in-code, easy to modify, seller blacklist functionality
* Replacing the indirect clickable "Bekijk meer advertenties" functionality, that scrolls you down to the "Bekijk alle advertenties" with directly going to that actual page. (Like it used to be)

Suggestions or ideas are of course most welcome.
